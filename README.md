Natural Language Processing Project for my submission of my learning in Dicoding about machine learning to classify text data. This project is about classifying text to several classes of emotion. I used TensorFlow and Keras for the machine learning model.

A project for my submission of my learning in Dicoding about machine learning to classify image of rock, paper, and scissors with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). I used Python with TensorFlow and Keras for this project. I also applied hyperparameter tuning to help find the optimal model using Keras-Tuner. I use Google Colab notebook to run the notebook, so I recommend to use Google Colab if you want to try my notebook.

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/harisyf/projects/blob/main/images/E-Commerce%20-%20Illustration.jpeg"> **[Brazilian E-Commerce RFM Analysis](https://github.com/harisyf/rfm-analysis-in-ecommerce)**

An RFM analysis project. This project aims to do RFM Analysis on E-commerce where the dataset is public dataset of orders made at Olist Store. The dataset has information on 100 thousand orders from 2016 to 2018 made in several marketplaces in Brazil.

My undergraduate final project as a Statistics student. Project about recommendation system to compare between the methods of matrix factorization and KNN with electronics products review data. The best practices of machine learning into real-world data. I used Python on this project with main library that I used is surprise, sklearn, and scipy. I successfully drawed a conclusion that matrix factorization recommendation system is better that KNN recommendation system.

Project that consist of 2-person. This dashboard was created to find out social conditions in Indonesia and also to know how far Indonesia achieve SDGs in social development. The data used to build this dashboard is data of BPS. We used R to create the dashboard and published it with RShiny which can be accessed on this [link](https://yafie345.shinyapps.io/SDGs_Sosial/)

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/harisyf/projects/blob/main/images/pokemon.jpeg"> **[Exploratory Data Analysis of Pokémon Universe Using R Software](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Rkwwu_E2ZvWas7IZEmOR1ggOlbALTFNU/view)**

This project was a 2-person team project. We were exploring Pokémon Universe data from Kaggle. We used R to perform data cleaning, data exploration, and data visualization. Library that we used was ggplot2. My contribution on this project was creating bar chart and violin plot. From this project we successfully learned how to analyze and visualize using R.
