A personal project to showcases a human resources information system (HRIS) dashboard built using Tableau. It provides insights into human resource metrics, helping HR professionals make informed decisions about talent management, workforce planning, and employee engagement. The dataset that I used for this project is [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset) from Kaggle with a size of 1,470. Link to my dashboard on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/HRAnalytics_17053237748300/Overview?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

A personal project to showcases a vehicle sales dashboard built using Microsoft Power BI. It provides insights into key sales performance metrics and trends, helping stakeholders make informed business decisions. The dataset that I used for this project is [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ddosad/auto-sales-data) from Kaggle with a size of 2,747.

A project for my submission of my learning in IDCamp 2023 about machine learning to make an animal images classification. This project is about classifying animal images using transfer learning with MobileNetV2 and then convert the trained model into TFLite. The model created by using Python with TensorFlow and Keras. I use Google Colab notebook to run my code, so I recommend to use Google Colab if you want to try my code. The dataset that I used for this project is [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessiocorrado99/animals10) from Kaggle.

A project for my submission of my learning in IDCamp 2023 about machine learning to make a forecast. This project is about forecasting energy consumption in US especially in PJM West Region. The model created by using Python with TensorFlow and Keras. The dataset that I used for this project is this dataset from Kaggle. I used the PJMW Hourly dataset with a size of 143,206. On the Kaggle site, the dataset has a range of years from 2002 to 2018, but in this project I'll limit the years from 2013 to 2018.

A project for my submission of my learning in Dicoding about machine learning to classify image of rock, paper, and scissors with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). I used Python with TensorFlow and Keras for this project. I also applied hyperparameter tuning to help find the optimal model using Keras-Tuner. I use Google Colab notebook to run the notebook, so I recommend to use Google Colab if you want to try my notebook.

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/harisyf/projects/blob/main/images/E-Commerce-Illustration.png"> **[Brazilian E-Commerce RFM Analysis](https://github.com/harisyf/rfm-analysis-in-ecommerce)**

An RFM analysis project. This project aims to do RFM Analysis on E-commerce where the dataset is public dataset of orders made at Olist Store. The dataset has information on 100 thousand orders from 2016 to 2018 made in several marketplaces in Brazil. I also create a dashboard of this project that you can access [here](https://rfm-analysis-in-ecommerce-dashboard-haris.streamlit.app/)

<img align="left" width="250" height="180" src="https://github.com/harisyf/projects/blob/main/images/recommendation.png"> **[Recommendation System with Collaborative Filtering Technique Using Matrix Factorization and KNN (Case Study: Electronic Products in E-Commerce)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RpSYxun9cTJBYBTKX4yZJPSTDfGQi1hk/view?usp=sharing)**

My undergraduate final project as a Statistics student. Project about recommendation system to compare between the methods of matrix factorization and KNN with electronics products review data. The best practices of machine learning into real-world data. I used Python on this project with main library that I used is surprise, sklearn, and scipy. I successfully drawed a conclusion that matrix factorization recommendation system is better that KNN recommendation system.

Project that consist of 2-person. This dashboard was created to find out social conditions in Indonesia and also to know how far Indonesia achieve SDGs in social development. The data used to build this dashboard is data of BPS. We used R to create the dashboard and published it with RShiny which can be accessed on this [link](https://yafie345.shinyapps.io/SDGs_Sosial/)

This project was a 2-person team project. We were exploring Pokémon Universe data from Kaggle. We used R to perform data cleaning, data exploration, and data visualization. Library that we used was ggplot2. My contribution on this project was creating bar chart and violin plot. From this project we successfully learned how to analyze and visualize using R.
